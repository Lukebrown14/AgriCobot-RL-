Still needs lots of work 

What needs adding/editing:

  - Convert into ROS package 
  - Create RobotGazeboEnv
  - Install TensorFlow package onto this (Use link below) 
  - Debug/Testing  
  
 Using the A3C_Continuous DeepLearning algorithm from https://github.com/marload/DeepRL-TensorFlow2/blob/876266d9a5fcf7d8a7c7e3afd8b110085b32b615/A3C/A3C_Continuous.py 
 
 How to run: 
 
 rosrun AgriCobot_RL A3C_Continuous_fetch.py (Not ready till ROS package is created)
